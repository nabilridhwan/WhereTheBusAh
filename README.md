## Getting Started
For debugging or developing purposes and to make the app locally, make sure that you have the essentials dependencies installed as defined in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Since this app leverages `LTA Datamall's` REST API, you would need to obtain your own API Key from `https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall.html`. After obtaining the API Key or rather, AccountKey, Replace `"KEY_HERE"` in HomePage.dart to your AccountKey or API Key enclosed in `""` and build the app or debug the app by running `flutter run` or `flutter run --release`.
